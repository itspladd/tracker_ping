# tracker_ping
Play a sound every 30 minutes to remind you to do something.

I'm currently using this to track side effects of medication, and how they might change (or not) depending on my water and food consumption.

Data is tracked manually in an external Google Doc spreadsheet (for now).

## Usage

Super simple:

1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` or `node index.js`

Leave the terminal open and it will play a cheerful sound every 30 minutes.
